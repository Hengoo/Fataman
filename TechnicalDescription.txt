Technical description:

The website is hosted on https://fataman.tk/

The github link for the source code: https://github.com/Hengoo/Fataman

Since the project is a website it mainly consists out of html, css and some javascript.
The 3D environment is written with the libary three.js 
Libary documentation: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene

Short description of each file:

index.html
	the main page

FatamanBuy.html
	List of available apartments with buttons to filter by different attributes
	Sorting and button management is done by javascript (in js/listSort.js)
